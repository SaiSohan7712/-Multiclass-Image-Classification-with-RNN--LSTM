# -Multiclass-Image-Classification-with-RNN--LSTM
 - Developed a multiclass image classification model using RNN-LSTM on the MNIST dataset, achieving 97% accuracy.
 - Preprocessed image data and applied LSTM architecture to capture sequential patterns in pixel values.
 - Tuned hyperparameters and optimized the model for improved accuracy and performance in digit classification.
